*** Pankomacs
****** opinionated opinionated emacs configuration (ft. flakes)
-----

*** What is this configuration?

This is a Nix flake for my Emacs configuration, similar to [[https://github.com/nix-community/kickstart-nix.nvim][kickstart-nix.nvim]].
This was put in my =~/.emacs.d/= so I added some files to exclude in my =.gitignore=.

-----

*** Where did the name come from?
Pankomacs and "opinionated opinionated emacs configuration" came from a mix between Emacs and [[https://www.instagram.com/fatfatpankocat/][fatfatpankocat]].
Other suggested named were "Plusmacs" based off of this discord conversation:
